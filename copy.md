About Boosst
At Boosst, we believe charging your EV should be as easy as charging your phone. At home and overnight.

The reality? Nearly 95% of multifamily buildings don’t offer charging—or they provide slow, shared, unreliable stations that frustrate residents and burden property owners.

We’re changing that.

Boosst delivers EV Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) for multifamily properties. That means:

Zero upfront cost – we fund the installation.
Zero ongoing management – we handle billing, support, and maintenance.
Dedicated personal chargers – residents plug in overnight at home, instead of fighting over public stations.
Our turnkey approach keeps residents happy, improves retention, and increases property value—all without risk or expense to ownership.
