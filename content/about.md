At Boosst, we believe charging your EV should be as easy as charging your phone. At home and overnight.

The reality? Nearly 95% of multifamily buildings don’t offer charging—or they provide slow, shared, unreliable stations that frustrate residents and burden property owners.  

We’re changing that.  

Boosst delivers EV Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) for multifamily properties. That means:

- **Zero upfront cost** – we fund the installation.  
- **Zero ongoing management** – we handle billing, support, and maintenance.  
- **Dedicated personal chargers** – residents plug in overnight at home, instead of fighting over public stations.  

Our turnkey approach keeps residents happy, improves retention, and increases property value—all without risk or expense to ownership.
