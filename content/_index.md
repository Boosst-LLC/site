### The Boosst Solution

- **Zero CAPEX, zero OPEX** — We finance site feasibility, permitting, installation, and hardware
- **Dedicated personal chargers** — Every resident gets their own charger instead of sharing
- **No electrical upgrades** — <span class="highlight">trueboosst</span>&trade; DLM balances chargers across 10–40A within existing infrastructure
- **Complete turnkey service** — Site assessment, design, permits, installation, billing, 24/7 support, and maintenance

### Why It Matters

- **90% of EV charging happens at home** — Apartment residents deserve the same convenience
- **EV adoption is surging** — Tenants expect on-site charging like internet or a gym
- **Retain high-value renters** — Properties without charging risk losing EV-driving tenants

### The Impact

- **Increased NOI and property value** through premium amenity offerings
- **Higher tenant retention** with hassle-free, dedicated charging
- **Future-proof properties** ready for growing EV demand

### The Problems with Public Charging

Without on-site charging, residents face:
- Out-of-service or inoperable chargers
- Slow charging speeds and long waits
- Payment hassles and connectivity issues
- Hidden fees and misleading pricing
- Occupied spots and inconvenient locations

*If you have an existing shared charging solution, we are potentially open to acquiring it.*
